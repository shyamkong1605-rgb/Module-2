# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## 🧾 Program
a = int(input())           # to get input-1 from the user

b = int(input())           # to get input-1 from the user

sum = lambda a,b: a+b      # defining a lambda function to add two numbers to the variable sum 

print(sum(a,b))            # to print the output of the lambda sum
